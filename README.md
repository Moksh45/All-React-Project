# React.js Project Showcase

This repository serves as a showcase for all of my React.js projects. It contains various React.js applications that demonstrate my skills and expertise in building web applications using React.js. Each project is stored in its own directory within this repository.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized in the following structure:

```
├── project-1
│   ├── src
│   ├── public
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── project-2
│   ├── src
│   ├── public

│   └── ...
├── project-3
│   ├── src
│   ├── public
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each project has its own directory with the project's source code (`src` folder), any necessary public assets (`public` folder), and a `README.md` file that provides details about the project.
